                                    appropriate selection. As a government contractor subject to Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA), we
                                    request this information in order to measure the effectiveness of the outreach and positive recruitment efforts we undertake
                                    pursuant to VEVRAA. classNameification of protected categories is as follows:

                                    A "disabled veteran" is one of the following: a veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled
                                    to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to
                                    compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.

                                    A "recently separated veteran" means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's  discharge or release from active duty in the  U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service.

                                    We’re looking for an experienced Brand Design Manager to join our design leadership team and help shape and direct not just our visual language and brand, but our people
                                    and the ways we design. As a Senior Design Manager, you’ll be responsible for developing and growing our brand and marketing design team - working closely with
                                    each designer on career development and personal growth. You’ll work closely with leadership across Marketing and Product to  Brand and Design teams, and develop new

                                    design work. We collaborate and work across the company to balance the needs of athletes, the needs of our business, speed and technical constraints to create and
                                    maintain a cohesive experience across all touchpoints of Strava. Additionally, at times you’ll work with photographers, motion graphics experts, and external agencies to
                                    ensure our work is extraordinary. We appreciate designers who have a passion for details, think deeply, speak clearly, strive for impact and embrace collaboration and
                                    feedback. As a leader on the team, you'll connect design, marketing, and product to create work that is both beautiful and impactful.
